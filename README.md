ABSTRACT


This study focuses on determining the energy eigenvalues of the quantum mechanical finite square
well potential by solving the transcendental equations derived from the Schr√∂dinger equation.
Previous studies have primarily relied on graphical methods, which, while sufficient in explaining
the system‚Äôs qualitative characteristics, have limited accuracy due to the scale used. In this study,
we use a hybrid numerical methods approach that combines the bisection and quadratic approximation methods
to obtain accurate, discrete energy values for each bound state. Additionally, the effects of varying
key parameters, such as well depth (ùëâ0) and well width (2ùëé) on the number of bound states in the
well, are examined. The energy eigenvalues are used to generate the wavefunctions for each state,
which are then plotted. Results indicate that as the well becomes shallower, some bound states
vanish, leaving at least one even state. Conversely, a narrow, deep well supports only a single
bound state, approaching the characteristics of a delta function potential. This study provides an
accurate and comprehensive understanding of the finite square well system and confirms the
results shown in textbooks [Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by David J Griffiths et al] and [A paradigms approach to Quantum mechanics by David H McIntyre] which are obtained using a graphical approach.
